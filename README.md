# Neo_Chen's 16 Bit Virtual Machine (WIP)

![DCC GDP-8 Logo](https://gitlab.com/NeoWorkgroup/GDP-8/raw/master/Logo/DCC_GDP-8_Logo.png "Yes, this is our logo")

## Introduction:

DCC GDP-8 is a Virtual Machine similar to DEC PDP-8, with 16 bit Machine Word.
It has 16 Bit Memory Address and 8 Bit Field.
Due to the use of Hexdecimal, nearly everything is aligned to 4 Bit.
Our goal is to create a modern "minicomputer", just like DEC's PDP-8 or PDP-11

Because my C programming level is somewhat poor, it may not reach the goal :(
