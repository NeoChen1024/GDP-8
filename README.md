# Neo_Chen's 16 Bit Virtual Machine (WIP)

![DCC GDP-8 Logo](https://gitlab.com/NeoWorkgroup/GDP-8/raw/master/Logo/DCC_GDP-8_Logo.png "Yes, this is our logo")

## Introduction:

DCC GDP-8 is a 64 bit virtual machine with 24 bit memory address.
Our goal is to create a modern "minicomputer", just like DEC's PDP-8 or PDP-11

Because my C programming level is somewhat poor, it may not reach the goal :(
