; Assembler Syntax
; ================
; This is a simple comment
; All symbol is limited to 63 character long

A==0		; Define A as hexdecimal 0
.ADDR	100	; Starting Address (Hex)
START:	CLR
	LOAD	%A, TEMP
	HLT
COUNT:	CLR
	INC	%A
	J	R, Z, +2		; Relative condition jump (signed integer)
	J	R, Z, -2
	JMP	S, @NOPE		; @ means indirect access, target is always Long Address,
	JMP	@NOPE			; if address length is unspecified, like this, assmebler will try to guess

TEMP:	.HEX	0			; Note that constants are in hexdecimal, not octal
HW:	.ASCII	"Hello, World!\n"	; ASCII Encoded Text
NOPE:	START	; Contains full address (Long Address) (3 Bytes)
