Assembler Syntax
================

The syntax of GDP-8's Assembler is similar to PDP-8's,
but our IOT have "namespaces", different device's pulse code name
won't interfere.
It will be like this:

/ This is a simple comment
/ Label is limited to 31 character long

*100	/ Starting Address (Hex)
CLEAR,	IOT CPU CAF
	CLA CLL
	IOT CPU HLT
COUNT,	CLA CLL
	ISZ TEMP
	JMP .-1
	JMP CLEAR
TEMP,	#0	/ Note that constants are in hexdecimal, not octal
