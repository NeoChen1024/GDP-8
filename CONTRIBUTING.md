# How to contribute
1. Just write your code, and I will merge it. (With or without debugging, whatever)
2. This is a hobbist project, please don't get serious.
3. Write C code in whatever the style you like.
4. Indent with [Tab], 2, 4, or 8 spaces is space insufficient. (Consumes 2, 4, or 8 Bytes, while [Tab] is only one byte)
5. Use Clang as default compiler, GCC has so many problems.
